# Ohio-Natural-Gas-Reliability-Analysis.

This project analyzes the reliability of Ohio's natural gas production and how it affects residential consumers. Using publicly available data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA.gov), I examined key trends in production, pricing, and consumption patterns over recent years.

### üîç Project Focus
The analysis uncovers a concerning trend: while Ohio's natural gas production is gradually decreasing, residential natural gas prices are steadily increasing. This trend coincides with a growing demand for electric power, particularly as energy providers increasingly rely on natural gas to generate electricity and strengthen the power grid.

### ‚ö° Key Insights
Rising Demand, Shrinking Supply: As Ohio pushes to expand and stabilize its electric power grid, natural gas is being redirected from residential use to energy conversion suppliers.

Impact on Pricing: The shift is contributing to a noticeable rise in residential gas prices across the state.

Interstate Implications: Ohio isn‚Äôt just a consumer of natural gas ‚Äî it's also a major supplier to neighboring states. As more natural gas is consumed locally for electricity generation, the supply available to other states may begin to decline.

### üìä Tools & Techniques
Data sourced from EIA.gov

Cleaned and analyzed using Tableau and Excel

Visualized insights with Tableau and line charts highlighting correlations between production, consumption, and pricing



### üåê Why This Matters
Ohio sits at the intersection of production and distribution in the natural gas supply chain. As the state's grid becomes more electrified and energy-hungry, the stress placed on its natural gas resources has consequences not only for residents but for the broader region relying on its exports. This project aims to shed light on those pressures and inform future infrastructure or policy decisions.
